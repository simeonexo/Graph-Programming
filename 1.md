# Data Structures for Graphs
- Adjacency Matrix
  - assumes it takes *zero* cost going from one node to itself
  - space efficient for *dense* graphs
  - simplest implementation
  - O(1) edge weight lookup time
  - O(V^2) space
  - O(V^2) iteration time
- Adjencency List
  - space efficient for *sparse* graphs
  - O(E) edge weight lookup time
- Edge List
  - space efficient for *sparse* graphs
  - efficient iteration
  - lacks structure
  - O(E) edge weight lookup time
# Common Problems
## Shortest path
unweighted BFS, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A*, ...
## Connectivity
Union find data structure, DFS, BFS, other search algs
## Negative cycles
Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
## Strongly Connected Components
Tarjan's and Kosaraju's algorithm
## Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Held-Karp, branch-and-bound, other approximation algs
## Bridges
- a bridge edge is any edge that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in a graph
## Articulation points
- an articulation point is any node that, when removed, increases the number of connected components in a graph
## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Kruskal's, Prim's & Boruvka's algorithm
## Network flow: max flow
Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp & Dinic's algorithm
# Algorithms
## DFS
- O(V+E) time
- good for *connectivity-like* problems
## BFS
- O(V+E) time
- uses a queue
- good for *finding shortest path* on *unweighted graphs*
### BFS on a grid
assumption: grid is unweighted and moves wsad
- convert the grid to an adjacency matrix/list
- possible early termination
